# Masking Text on Image

[![Masking Text on Image Screenshots](assets/git-screenshots01.png)](https://codenaud.github.io/masking-text-on-image/)

## Description

This is a small design project in HTML and CSS that seeks to emulate a feature widely used in graphic design tools such as Photoshop, Figma and other image editors. This is the effect of a text layer mask superimposed on an image, achieved through styling and layout techniques in CSS. Through this project, I have created a visual experience that allows users to creatively add text over a background image, giving them the ability to customize and stylize the text according to their preferences. This recreation of a text layer mask in CSS is an example of how attractive and functional visual effects can be achieved in web design, demonstrating my skill in creating stunning visual elements using front-end technologies such as HTML and CSS.
